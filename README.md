# Cybersickness-Automation

This repository contains the automation part of my master’s thesis project.

Instructions on how to use it during the experiment are provided in `Automation.md`.

## What could be improved

If I had to make it again, I would:

1. Create a `Helpers` folder to store all utility scripts.
2. Create a main file that combines all components and starts the GUI.
3. Create a `doc` folder to store `Automation.md` and other documentation.
4. Establish a consistent naming convention.
5. Translate everything into English.
